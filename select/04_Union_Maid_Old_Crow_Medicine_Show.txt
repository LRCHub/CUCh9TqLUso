Now there once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of the goons and the ginks and the company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall where a meeting it was called,
And when the boys would come up to her
Oh this is what she'd say

(Chorus)
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

Now this union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,

She'd take the dare, she didn't care, she always organized the guys.
And she always got her way when she asked for better pay.
She showed her card to the National Guard
Honey this is what they'd say

(Chorus)

Now you girls who want to be free, just take a little tip from me;
Oh get you a man who's a union man and you can join the ladies' auxiliary.
Because married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
And a union life is a happy life when you got a union wife.

(Chorus x2)
